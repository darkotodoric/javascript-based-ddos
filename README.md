# JavaScript-based DDoS
JavaScript-based DDoS is a type of DDoS attack where JavaScript is used to generate a large number of requests to a targeted website or server. These requests can be generated from various devices and browsers, making the attack harder to detect and defend against.

## Why it's dangerous?
JavaScript-based DDoS is an exceptionally perilous threat, as malevolent actors can inject such scripts into already compromised websites, effectively utilizing their traffic as a potent weapon for executing devastating DDoS attacks. This presents a deeply alarming scenario since, unbeknownst to the proprietors of compromised sites, all visitors unwittingly contribute to the assault.

What makes this threat particularly insidious is that it renders traditional IP blocking methods nearly ineffective. Since the traffic originates from real users, it becomes exceedingly challenging to distinguish between legitimate visitors and malicious agents.

Furthermore, when considering a website with **10,000** visitors in the span of an hour, the potential impact becomes staggering. This influx of users could result in a mind-boggling **3,600,000,000** requests directed towards the site in just one hour. This highlights the fact that even with a relatively modest volume of visitors, this type of attack can unleash a torrent of requests, causing significant damage.

## How to protect from this attack?
In many cases, unfortunately, the only effective protection against "JavaScript-based DDoS" attacks may indeed be implementing CAPTCHA verification for all visitors during a specific time period. This measure means that all users will need to solve CAPTCHA challenges to prove that they are real humans and not automated bots.
